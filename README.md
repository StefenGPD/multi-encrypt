### Introduction
The project “Multilayered Text Encryptor” is a software that accepts text files and
converts them into encrypted text. It utilizes well-known historical encryption techniques
and raises their complexity by compounding on them several times. This results in a
ciphertext (the encrypted product) that has been encrypted multiple times; thus, the idea
of a “multilayered” encryption. The objective of such a formula is to throw off any
conventional decryption program as it does not utilize standard procedures of
encryptions.
